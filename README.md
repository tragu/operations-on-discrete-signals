# operations-on-discrete-signals
This repo contains operations on discrete signals like Time scaling, Amplitude scaling, Time shifting, Signal addition and Signal multiplication.<br>
Note: Zero index = position number while counting from '1'<br>
Ex: x={1,2,3,5}.<br>
If zero is at 5, then the position of 5 from starting is 4 so zero index=4
